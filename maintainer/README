This file is intended for maintainers of FoxTrick, including notes for
version and releasing.


Version Scheme
==============
FoxTrick has two major channels of versions, one is stable version for daily
use and another is nightly version for testing.

The major version number has two digits separated by dot, like 0.7, 0.8, and
1.0.
For minor version over major stable releases, a number starting from 1 is
appended, like: 0.7.1, 0.7.2, etc.
As for nightly builds, take an example to demonstrate: the nightlies before
0.7 is 0.6.9 plus revision, like: 0.6.9.6345. When 0.7 is released it's then
like 0.7.9.6653.

Version Bump
============
A version bump comes after the release of a major stable version

Keep in mind to modify the following files: (version.sh can/should be used for that)
* install.rdf (For Gecko)
* manifest.json (For Chrome)
* config.xml (For Opera)
* Info.plist (For Safari)
* default/preferences/foxtrick.js (For Foxtrick.version())

Releasing Nightly Versions
==========================
These are uploaded to foxtrick.foundationhorizont.org (thanks to ljushaff
for providing the space!) automatically (thanks to convincedd for providing
the server!) at 12:00 CET everyday.

Releasing Stable Versions
=========================
Do these things in order:
* Bump version.
* Set URL to 'http://foxtrick.foundationhorizont.org/release' & DEST and DIST to 'release' in upload.conf.sh
  * Build and upload to foxtrick.org using upload-nightly.sh
* Build with `make DIST_TYPE=hosting`, 
  * Gecko: Upload foxtrick.xpi to addons.mozilla.org
  * Chrome: Upload foxtrick.zip to Chrome extension hosting (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/edit/bpfbbngccefbbndginomofgpagkjckik)
  * Opera: Upload foxtrick.oex to Opera's hosting (https://addons.opera.com/de/developer/). no version uploaded yet.  
* Edit homepage at Google Code and foxtrick.org.
* Write a new post at Hattrick forum.
