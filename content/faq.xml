		<question>How could I style my FoxTrick?</question>
		<answer>
			<xhtml:p>
				FoxTrick provides a set of presentation interfaces for users to customise their own styles.
				These interfaces are provided through HTML IDs and classes, and you can use CSS to define your preferred style.
			</xhtml:p>
			<xhtml:p>
				An example user style file can be found <xhtml:a href="chrome://foxtrick/content/resources/css/user-content-example.css">here</xhtml:a>, which you can modify to satisfy your need.
				After saving the file, you can use the SkinPlugin module for loading the CSS file to have the user style in effect.
