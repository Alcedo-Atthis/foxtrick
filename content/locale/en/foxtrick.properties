foxtrick.confirmstripserver=Do you want to strip the Hattrick server from links to make them usable in the forum?
foxtrick.linkscustom.helptext=First, this is just the editor mode. Clicking on the header of this box switches between editor and normal mode. Only in normal mode your own links are fully functional. External static links are easy to add, just add the full url (Example\: http\://example.org/league/427/). For internal static links skip the server part (Example\: /World/Series/Default.aspx?LeagueLevelUnitID\=427). You only need the tags for rarer dynamic links. With tags the links are dynamically changed using the information of the page you are on. For example http\://example.org/league/[LeagueID] would always lead you to the page of the series with the ID that you are just viewing in Hattrick. The tags which are available on each page are listed in the select box. You can only use those which are listed on the page where you are adding your custom link. The text in the box is just a sample template. You can write a tag yourself (using []).
foxtrick.linkscustom.helptext2=You also can export your links and share them. Click on the export button and select a file to save the link. Links are appended to the file, hence you can save several links in one file. To import links go to the import section in the preferences. Only entries in the selected file will be imported, which in this case are your links. None of your existing links will be deleted.
