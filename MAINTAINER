This file is intended for maintainers of FoxTrick, including notes for bumping
version and releasing.


Version Bump
============
A version bump usually take place after a version is recently released. The
version is therefore needed to increase. For beta versions there is usually
a "b", denoting "beta" follows a major version number.

Keep in mind to modify the following files:
* install.rdf
* manifest.json
* content/data/htversions.xml
* default/preferences/foxtrick.js


Releasing Final Versions
========================
Do these things in order:
* Bump version.
* Write a release notes in Google Code and link to it.
* Build the release, add to mozdev and submit to addons.mozilla.org with
  respective <updateURL> in install.rdf. Remove <updateKey> for both.
  For mozdev, it's:
    https://www.mozdev.org/p/updates/foxtrick/{9d1f059c-cada-4111-9696-41a62d64e3ba}/update.rdf
  For addons.mozilla.org, leave the entry out.
* Create a branch in SVN repository.
* Edit homepage at Google Code and mozdev.
* Bump version to the beta of next release.
* Release the new beta version with identical content.
